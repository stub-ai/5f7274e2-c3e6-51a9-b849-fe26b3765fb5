The component currently has a useEffect hook and a map function, both setting shared documents based on certain conditions.\n\nIn the useEffect hook, if there are booking requests and the first one has a status of \"booked\", shared documents are set to the artist's documents. Otherwise, they are set from the booking request.\n\nIn the map function, shared documents are directly set from the booking request when a button is clicked.\n\nCreate a function that encapsulates this logic, which can be called in both the useEffect hook and the map function's onClick handler.","md5":"c101752b711bb9634bb63c84cf6c312c"}]}
